Portfoliojs
==========
**+ lightbox support**

jQuery plugin for your beautiful portfolio images with horizontal scrolling

This plugin was originally developed by Abhinay Omkar. This fork takes where he left off and allos the `<img>` to be warped inside `<a>`, so it works with [Fancybox](http://fancyapps.com/fancybox/), [Lighbtox](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2/), etc.
